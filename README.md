During your internship from August 2023 to November 2023, you worked on an Image Classification and Object Detection Model project. The primary objective was to develop an image classification model capable of efficiently and accurately categorizing 46 different types of pulses. Additionally, the project involved creating a robust REST API using Flask in Python to allow real-time predictions without the need to re-run the model for every request.

The project leveraged a tech stack that included Python for scripting, TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model, OpenCV for image preprocessing, and Flask to develop the REST API for real-time predictions.
